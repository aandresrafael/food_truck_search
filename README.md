# FoodTrucksApi

This is a project exercise as part of the hiring process at AgileEngine. I crated a web app to use food trucks data provided a make a text search.


## Dev environment.

YOu need to first fun migrations with `mix ecto.create` and then `mix ecto.migrate`

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Run `mix setup` to install and setup dependencies
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

Ready to run in production? Please [check our deployment guides](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/deployment.html).
